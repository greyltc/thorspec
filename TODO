Need to make it notice device vanishing - at the moment, some data are
cached, so you don't notice USB unplug, but a hardware access causes
a segfault.  
Perhaps OK - tidied open/close a bit

maybe need a real is-it-there function - use getDeviceStatus
IOError: Instrument not initialised   if never seen
IOError: lowlevel io error   if gone
else returns 'I', 'T' etc

# transform via calib curve (play with data offline first)
# if repeat_timeout not called (error), let's try to turn off runbut
# what happens to data/line if device absent?
